                <h3>Nonprofits</h3>
                <p>GlobalGiving is a nonprofit. Our community is free to join, and we don’t charge an application or
                    subscription fee. Instead, we retain a 5–12% nonprofit support fee on donations, plus 3% transaction
                    processing fee. But we’re committed to raising even more money for your organization than we retain
                    in
                    fees.</p>

                    When a disaster strikes, recovery efforts led by people who live and work in affected communities
                    are
